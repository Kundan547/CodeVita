""" Problem Statement:
We are given a grid where zombies (denoted by 1) can infect adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). The task is to determine the number of days it will take for all cells to be infected or return -1 if itâ€™s not possible.

Approach:
This is a Breadth-First Search (BFS) problem where we start from all zombie cells simultaneously and spread out. BFS ensures that we visit cells level-by-level, where each level represents one day.
